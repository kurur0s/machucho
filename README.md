# Machucho

In the farlands of Chiloé, there are myths and legends about a being that guards and keeps safe the caves and fortresses of warlocks. This deformed creature with a leg stick to its back and tongue cut in half, is called by many names but one that I really like is **Machucho**, because it also means sage or getting old in different languages.

So, to tidying up and keep track of my decks of the Chilean TCG **Mitos y Leyendas**, I've come up with a deformed and outdated web app to create and store decks to check the cards type ratio and identify the strategy tendency of each deck.

disclaimer: this project is just for personal use, so updates and troubleshooting falls under the i will deal with it later mental binder.

Deck builder for the TCG *Mitos y Leyendas*

## Simple

You can create and name a deck, and populate it with cards, while the app fix the maximum number of cards permitted.

## Clean

Its just a static page with some local storage property.

## Useful

There are a few variables shown for meta analysis of each deck.

## Soon, but no so soon

Instead of type everything in, the cards could be selected from a droplist.
