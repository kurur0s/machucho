In the farlands of Chiloé, there are myths and legends about a being that guard and keep safe the caves and fortresses of warlocks. 
This deformed creature is called by many names, but one that I really like is **Machucho** because it also means *sage* and *getting old* in different languages.

So, to tidying up and keep track of my decks of the Chilean TCG **Mitos y Leyendas**, I've came up with a web app to create and store decks to check the cards type ratio and identify the strategy tendency of each deck.

*disclaimer*: this project is just for personal use, so updates and troubleshooting falls under the `i'll deal later with it` category.
